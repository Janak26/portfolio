    <p>I am an analytics professional with experience spanning data science, machine learning, and business intelligence, working on large-scale datasets containing millions of records. My work focuses on building end-to-end data and machine learning solutions that are reliable, scalable, and grounded in real-world constraints.</p>

    <p>Over the course of my experience, I have built and deployed machine learning and deep learning models for classification, forecasting, and feature detection. I have worked extensively with NLP, computer vision, time-series modeling, ensemble methods, and statistical techniques, applying them to solve complex data problems across different domains. I have experience deploying models and analytics through APIs and batch pipelines. </p>

    <p>A part of my work has involved improving data reliability through automated validation checks, handling missing and noisy data, and ensuring that models are built on trustworthy foundations. I have built reporting and visualization systems that help bridge the gap between complex data and actionable decisions, ensuring that insights and predictions are accessible to both technical and non-technical stakeholders. </p>

    <p> I have obtained a Bachelor of Engineering in Electronics and Telecommunications from University of Mumbai. Later, I completed a Post Graduate Diploma in Financial Management from University of Mumbai. I came to Canada in 2023 and obtained a Graduate Diploma in Business Administration from Concordia University - John Molson School of Business. Thereafter, I worked at Neptronic as an Electronic Technician, putting good use to my education in Electronics Engineering. </p>


    <p>Outside of work, I have a Youtube Channel exploring Data Science concepts with the channel having more than 4000 hours of watch time. I have also taken up significant interest in running, having alredy run half marathons in Montreal and Toronto in 2025, and signed up for two more half marathons in Ottawa and Montreal in 2026, and a full marathon in Toronto in 2026. I also enjoy cycling, and will plan bikepacking trips this coming summer. I enjoy going to the gym and cooking. </p>


    <p>To get back to the data and analytics profession, I have developed this portfoio website to showcase my skills. Please explore the Projects page to check them out!</p>
